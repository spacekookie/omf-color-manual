Oh My Fish - Colour Manual
==========================

This is a very simple plugin which colourises the output of `man` which results in much nicer to read manual pages. It does so by simply setting some shell variables to colours. If you want to change them, feel free to tweak around with the values.

## Installation

You should be able to install `colorman` via [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).

```console
$ omf install colorman
```
