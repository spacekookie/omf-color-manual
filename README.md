Oh My Fish - Colour Manual
==========================

This is a very simple plugin which colourises the output of `man` which results in much nicer to read manual pages. It does so by simply setting some shell variables to colours. If you want to change them, feel free to tweak around with the values.

## Installation

You should be able to install `colorman` via [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).

```console
$ omf install colorman
```

Otherwise just download the `init.fish` script (possibly rename it `colorman.fish` and source it somewhere in your `config.fish`. Done :)

## Spelling

The project is officially spelt "oh my fish - color manual", `colorman` for short. But that doesn't mean I have to use wrong gramar (i.e. not spell it *colour* in the README. Just don't be confused :sweat_smile:)
